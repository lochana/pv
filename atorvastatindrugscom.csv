These drugs stop the essential HMG-CoA pathway in the body which produces many molecules that are essential for cellular health. They also build up in muscle tissue in their toxic lactone form. This is especially serious if you have an acidic blood pH. There are genetic variations in the bodies ability to clear these through the liver that can lead to a dangerous build-up of these drugs in your body. This basic biology is all hard science and confirmed by peer-reviewed studies.,,,,,,,,,

I was prescribed 10 mg 1 tablet to be taken per day. I was healthy with normal blood pressure and walked and exercised probably 4 miles per day and was generally fit and healthy. I was unable to take the tablet every day and ended up having to skip days because of the side effects. On day 3 it gave me a dizzy feeling and a sense of anger like wanting to snap at someone for no reason. Day 4 was a spacey feeling like floating and generally feeling like no desire to want to do anything. Went out for a walk got the most terrible muscle cramps in the calves which came and went. Also a panic anxiety feeling that lasted about a minute which felt like I was going to die and a general feeling of not being well. Then the doctor said take it every other day and this was causing me insomnia where I would sleep for a hour then be awake for 4 hours trying to sleep . Also very low sex drive and a feeling like I was being poisoned. Eventually came off it""",10-Jan,29,2,https://www.drugs.com/comments/atorvastatin/?search=&sort_reviews=top&page=2

The list is long on the adverse effects. dizzy, loss of balance, pain in head, ringing in ears, pressure in ears (went to ear noise and throat, said it was not in my ears.  I have heaviness and weakness in my legs, hard to walk far. Sleep problems, walking and talking while asleep, seizures Lasting a few seconds. this week other joints started hurting as well.

My cholesterol level was 225 and my left carotid artery via a Doppler was 50-70 percent narrowed.
