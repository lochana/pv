I could not lift my head or turn myself over.  I felt limp as if I were a rag doll .  I thought that I was dying and kept asking my husband to pray for me and call my pastor.

My new doctor did some tests to why I was feeling so unwell and it came back my prolactin level was 3500 which would of temporarily meant my fertility was down the drain, this scared me so much so I decided to listen to him and try come off it. It was so hard coming off it and I’m still suffering from it now. I have a massive phobia of sick and I thought this was my comfort blanket to ensure this nausea didn’t turn to sick however the side effects are not worth it. Try stay on it for as little time as possible and discuss other anti nausea medicines out there. All in all a very effective and quick drug to relieve nausea within a short amount of time but don’t rely on it like I did as I’m now suffering at a young age with a lot of physical problems!”",5 / 10,4

It is not meant to be used for more than a week and with the side effects we aren't just talking dry mouth we are talking serious irreversible movement disorders where you lose control of limbs and head. 
I took it for 6 months before someone removed it while I was   in for a  hospital stay. I was cross as it controlled the sickness well but when the side effects were explained I fully agreed with the decision I never new that was a possible side effect. If that had happened I'd be far worse off than just sickness.
I stopped taking the medicine the nauesa and vomiting returned more than ever but all the aches and pains that had gradually crept on dissappeared virtually over night. I was struggling with getting my neck comfortable enough to sleep that again went in 24 hours of stopping”",1 / 10,2

I have this complete sense of dread, I felt as though if I didn't get out of my own skin, or just that hospital, I felt I was going to die then and there. I honestly don't think actually dying will be as bad a feeling as this. I ripped out my IV, there was blood flinging everywhere along with the fluids that were dripping in. The doctor runs in yells at me then goes out and slams the door behind him. Which totally intensified my panic and I ran out of the hospital.

Reglan is the primary medication in this cocktail, benadryl is given to reduce the side effect known as akathisia. Both reglan and benadryl causes drowsiness, hence only half a dose is given. 250ml saline bags are used so we can control the rate of flow of the medication (to infuse slow over 20 minutes, we don't use an IV pump with these medications). Ketorolac is optional.
If not given correctly, in most cases infused as a bolus/wide open. This is where the problem occurs.

Yep, in just 3 months it will be two years since I have gotten this awful medication. I STILL have issues from what Reglan did to me. It is not uncommon for people to have tardive dyskinesia or akathasia from Reglan. I got akasthasia. For many the symptoms of akathasia go away in an hour or a few days. (Tardive dyskinesia on the other hand, can be permanent. In fact, like I said I got akathasia, not tardive dyskinesia.) Anyway, in many cases the akathasia subsides. But, it can hang on for some. I was one of those unfortunate people. There is a support group on Facebook called the Reglan Support Group for people who have had a harder time recovering from the injury of this drug.

The more I watched the clock slowly tick by and tried not to focus on the impending doom feeling the worse it got. I wanted to rip the IV out of my arm. Between the anxiety, wanting to run for the hills, and my pounding heart in my chest it was a miracle I didn’t scream bloody murder. This went on for a good 30 minutes before the feeling subsided and I passed out. Although the medicine made me extremely anxious, it did knock down the nausea. I hope this validates any concerns and past experiences. I do not have a history of psych, but with this medication I don’t believe there requires to be one to make you feel this way. Please do not let a doctor try to tell you that benadryl will make it better and cancel out the anxiety feeling or that you can breathe through it. Trust your instincts and self advocate!

Gabriella,,"December 7, 2021","Reglan (metoclopramide) for Migraine:		“PLEASE do NOT take Reglan. I am posting this experience from over 4 years ago from my reaction to reglan..that’s how impactful my reaction was to me. I suffer from migraines and I go to the ER whenever it’s really bad. I happened to go to a new hospital one night because I was out of town when a migraine hit me. They gave me some sort of migraine cocktail but with Reglan (which I’ve never had before). As soon as it was pushed through the IV I IMMEDIATELY started coughing uncontrollably, felt a cold rush going down my throat and extreme weight on my chest. I then began to hallucinate while looking around the room I felt like I was going insane. When I looked at the door in front of me all I could see were swirls just everywhere I can’t even explain what I was seeing. My whole body started to shake uncontrollably only letting up for a few seconds before starting again. I then had extreme memory loss when asked simple questions from the techs!! I am scarred for life”",1 / 10,0

I don’t throw up all day like I did with my first born, but the nausea makes it impossible to really eat or even take sips of water. I threw up my water yesterday and it was the final straw, sending me to UC. The doctor ordered 2L of NS and a reglan push. I too felt like taking the IV out of my arm, but I was also uncomfortable and shaking because, of course, the NS doesn’t feel so comfortable entering your body. I felt pretty ill for 15 minutes, then I knocked out. Honestly, after I felt way better. The nausea was non existent and I actually had an appetite where I was craving foods again. I didn’t want to take reglan, but I’ve tried all the tips and tricks one can do. I do not want to take it again, just because I don’t like taking medication during pregnancy, but it really helped. Today I’m back to barely having any appetite, for both food and water.”",9 / 10,1

At first they gave 1mg of ativan, 1,000 mg of acetaminophen, and 600 mg of ibuprofen. Even though it made me feel slightly better the tightness around my head was still there and the room was still spinning,  just not as bad. So they decided to give me ""the cocktail"" which included compazine, reglan, and imitrex. After about 15 minutes I felt so restless, like I needed to keep moving my body. I thought it was the combination of all the damn meds but then I stumbled on to this website. Now I know it was the reglan. Any way I was sent home with a prescription for reglan and was told to take with tylenol and advil for migraines. Well the first night I took it was up all night fighting against the worst anxiety attack I've ever had. It lasted all night long. Never again will I take this medicine.”",1 / 10,5

MoaningMyrtle,,"November 8, 2018","Reglan (metoclopramide) for Migraine:		“The urgent care center gave me a shot of reglan & toradol in my backside & benadryl.  The meds burned going in, but within 20 mins, my migraine had subsided.  Went home, slept. Next morning, woke up got ready feeling groggy, my chest was tight.  I went to work and felt  jittery, nauseous, dizzy then later I get very hot, cold & sweaty. Then I turned white as a sheet and got full body tremors.  I had to be picked up from work & brought back to urgent care.  Got to urgent care and they gave me ativan and said I had an anxiety attack.  The only thing that was different in my body/life was the fact that my migraine was now gone & was treated with those drugs. I'm not totally discounting the fact that I had an anxiety attack. In fact, it makes total sense the way I was feeling , but I definitely believe this drug triggered something unholy and TERRIFYING to happen in my body.  It did get rid of my migraine (which was the reason I needed it) I am grateful for that, but I was not aware of any adverse effects.”",5 / 10,7

The primary care we had explained how Reglan can only be used for short periods of time and although she took him off Reglan. Also, be aware that he was still gonna puke till he was weened off of it. The erythromycin he was given only gave him diarrhea, and was still puking. They need way more research for this because the 2 options you give to these people are garbage.

I used it to treat stomach motility. I've been admitted in the ER many times during flare ups (severe nausea/vomiting/no sleeping/misery that would last for days) and as soon as I would get it through and IV, I would feel so good! So it's a miracle drug when it comes to treating nausea/vomiting. 
I took only 10mg, because of the warnings and only took it at night and if I needed it (if I ate something that would not digest) 
It worked really well to manage gastroparesis. I started to function, gain weight, eat food.
